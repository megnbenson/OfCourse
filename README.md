  The list of backlog items "done"in this sprint, actions for any items not “done”
oSprint retrospective:  
  A list of thingsthat went well, improvements and action plan.
## **Sprint one Retro**
### **What went well:**
I now know how databases work, model first. ReCreating a database many times from scratch but in doing so have got a working database, and has taken away the fear from it
Also explored the WPF toolbox, making use of checkboxes, stack panels and tabs

### **What could be improved**
Take breaks! Look carefully at the error messages and the migrations.
I could have drawn an ERD with an online tool, but instead I did it manually and then made a class diagram.
### **what is your action plan for next**
Action plan is to do tests, Add more CRUD operations and bing the category lists on the filters list.

#### Overall project retrospective 
  –what have you learned, 
  what would you do differently next time, 
  what would you do next?
•A note of which class diagrams are included in your code projects 
  –name of the diagram(s), and 
  where to find them.
•Screenshots of the Kanban board (start and end of each sprint).  
These can be in the same filealongside the documentation of each sprint, or together in a separate document.
•User guide 
–how does the user start theapplication, is there anything they need to know to get started such as the connection stringor how to run the migrations?
